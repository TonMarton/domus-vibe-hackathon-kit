# Domus Hackathon Kit

A hackathon starter kit with AI-powered dev agents. You describe what you want to build — Claude builds it with you.

## Getting Started

1. **Download this repo** — click the green "Code" button on GitHub, then "Download ZIP". Unzip it somewhere on your computer.

2. **Install Docker Desktop** — download from [docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and make sure it's running.

3. **Open a Claude session** — start a new conversation with Claude on your computer (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

4. **Tell Claude where the project is** — say something like:
   > Read the CLAUDE.md in /path/to/domus-vibe-hackathon-kit and help me get started.

Claude will take it from there — setting up the environment, starting the dev server, and helping you build your hackathon project.
